  Single front door for a repo's automation loops, so one routine per repo can

  routes each triggering GitHub event (parsed from the trigger block, decided by
  route-event.sh) to the matching loop skill; a non-matching event is a quiet
  no-op. It only routes; each loop owns its own guardrails. Repo-agnostic;

  events.

# loop-dispatch

The **front door** to a repo's automation loops. A committed GitHub Action routes each
loop event at the edge (via `route-event.sh`) and fires this routine **only on a match**,
handing it the resolved route. This skill **dispatches that route** to the matching loop —
one routine per repo instead of one per loop/event.

It is a **router, not a worker.** It never builds, merges, or releases anything
itself; it invokes the loop skill that owns that job, and that skill enforces all its
own gates, models, and notifications. loop-dispatch adds no policy of its own.

## The routing table

`route-event.sh` (run **at the edge** by the caller workflow — see new-loop-routine and
[`references/webhook-context.md`](references/webhook-context.md), not here) maps the exact
`(event, action, label|state)` tuple to a loop. Anything unmatched → the routine is
**never fired**. The mapping it applies:

| event | action | label / state | Run |
|---|---|---|---|
| `issues` | `labeled` | label = `ready-for-ai` | **`/issue-loop`** (cloud mode) |
| `issues` | `labeled` | label = `auto-release` (issue title `release <version>`) | **`/auto-release-loop`** |
| `pull_request` | `labeled` | label = `auto-merge` | **`/merge-flow`** |
| `pull_request` | `labeled` | label = `auto-rework` | **`/rework-loop`** |

Rework is a **label**, not the review event — uniform with the rest, and it works with one
account (you can't fire a `pull_request_review` workflow by reviewing your *own* PR, and
the loop's identity is often the reviewer's). Flow: a reviewer leaves comments, then adds
`auto-rework` to say "address these". Review events route nowhere.

Everything else — `pull_request.opened`, a PR labelled `dependencies`/`javascript`, an
issue labelled anything else, any review event — matches **no row**, so the edge never
fires the routine. This is what kills the wasteful fires: a Dependabot PR labelled
`dependencies` woke merge-flow **4× overnight** under per-event routines; here the edge
stops immediately, waking no routine.

## Config (resolve once)

- **Repo** — identify the current repo (github-ops → *Detect base branch / repo*).
- **github-ops required** — every downstream loop uses it; it must be installed.

## Step 1 — take the resolved route

Your turn contains the decision the **edge already made** — e.g.
`route=merge-flow repo=umbraco/… number=269`. The caller workflow ran `route-event.sh`
and only fired you because it matched, so **take that route as given; don't re-derive it.**
(If a fire ever arrives with no resolved route, **quiet no-op** — never go looking for work.)

**Cross-repo issues.** When a repo's issues live in a *separate* repo from its source, the
route also carries a `target=<code repo>` distinct from the event's `repo` (where the label
fired). In that case **work against `target`** — check it out and load *its* skills/config —
while reading the issue from the event `repo`. When no `target` is present, event repo ==
work repo (the common case).

**Re-check the entity before acting.** Between the event and this session a label can be
removed or the PR/issue closed. Fetch it (github-ops → `issue_read`/`pull_request_read`,
`method: "get"`, exact `owner`/`repo`/`number`) and confirm it still carries the
triggering label / is still open. If not, **quiet no-op**.

## Step 2 — dispatch the route

Invoke the matched skill exactly as its own dedicated routine would, scoped to the
specific issue/PR, and **follow that skill's instructions verbatim**:

- `ready-for-ai` issue → **`/issue-loop`** for that issue — the consumer's entry skill,
  which loads its build playbook and defers orchestration to `issue-loop-core` (cloud mode
  when fired by a routine, local mode when run by hand).
- `auto-merge` PR → **`/merge-flow`** (it sweeps all `auto-merge` PRs; the event is
  just the wake-up).
- PR review changes-requested → **`/rework-loop`** for that PR.
- `auto-release` issue → **`/auto-release-loop`**, version taken from the issue title.

**One event → one loop.** Do not chain (don't build *then* merge *then* release in a
single fire) — each of those has its own event that will dispatch its own run. Hand
off and stop.

There is deliberately **no sweep / "check everything" fallback** — routing is only ever
driven by a real event through `route-event.sh`. No event, or an unmatched one, is a
quiet no-op. (Working a whole backlog is a separate, explicit action: run the relevant
loop skill directly.)

## Rules

- **Route, never reimplement.** loop-dispatch only invokes the loop skills. All
  merge/build/release/review policy, models, caps, and notifications live in those
  skills — defer to them completely.
- **Re-check preconditions.** Never act on a stale event; if the label's gone or the
  PR/issue is closed, quiet no-op.
- **One event, one loop.** No chaining within a single fire.
- **Respect each loop's gate** — `ready-for-ai` for building, `auto-merge` as the
  merge approval, `auto-release` to ship. loop-dispatch does not relax any of them.
- **Quiet by default.** Say nothing unless a delegated loop does — don't add a
  dispatch-level notification on top of the loop's own.
- **github-ops for all GitHub work.** Name the operation; it owns the command/tool.
- **Never use `fable`.** The dispatcher runs on a cheap base model (inherit the
  routine's model); the real work — and its model choice — happens inside the loop
  skills and their subagents.

## Wiring it

To stand up the one routine per repo, use the
[`new-loop-routine`](../new-loop-routine/SKILL.md) skill — it owns the standardised
config, the locked prompt template, and the event-wiring steps.
